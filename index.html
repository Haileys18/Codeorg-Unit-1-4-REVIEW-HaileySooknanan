  <b>UNIT 1</b>
      <hr>
      <p> Unit 1 in code.org was about learning the basics of csp. This was achieved by first learning how to start an html page with tags that define certain types of words or images. For example h1-h6 was headings, p was paragraph, body was what user sees, img was to insert an image and table; td, tr, th are how to set up a table.  Then we learned how to link with a tag followed by href or img. After that we learned binay code, the most basic form of computer code, consisting of two numbers: 0 and 1. This can be used to represent colors made up of red, blue, and green; RBG. This was to create different colors: the 3 zeros of the binary code which consist of 9 zeros in total, left to right goes from red to blue to green. When an 0 is replaced by 1 it is turned on meaning the value is being used.  This creates different colors of a mix between the three colors. After this we learned sampling that takes in real life pictures and puts them online, the quality is depending on the type of compression. Lossless compression is when the full image uses every pixel to create the detailed image, lossy compression is when the internet doesnâ€™t use as many pixels as to save data and space.</p>

      <p> In the realm of computing, various interconnected terms shape the landscape of modern technology. A computing device serves as a fundamental unit for processing information, while protocols dictate the rules for communication between devices, often facilitated through packets. These devices collectively form a computing system, often designed with redundancy to ensure continuous operation and fault tolerance. Routers manage the flow of data across computing networks, including the vast expanse of the World Wide Web, where IP addresses facilitate communication between devices. The internet, governed by Internet Protocol, transcends geographical boundaries but faces challenges like the digital divide. HTTP governs the transfer of web data, with bandwidth defining the speed of data transmission along a path. Achieving fault-tolerant systems in this interconnected web is crucial for seamless operation and efficient communication.

  <b>UNIT 3</b>

      <p> In the realm of computer science, the user interface serves as the gateway between humans and machines, facilitating interaction and communication. Sequential programming dictates the linear execution of instructions, guiding the flow of operations within a program. Output represents the result or information generated by a program's execution. Program statements encapsulate specific instructions within a program, shaping its functionality. Programs themselves are sets of instructions designed to accomplish tasks or solve problems. Event-driven programming orchestrates actions in response to user or system-generated events, fostering dynamic and interactive applications. Events denote significant occurrences triggering responses within a software system. The development process encompasses the phases of designing, coding, testing, and deploying software solutions, ensuring their effectiveness and reliability. Documentation provides comprehensive records detailing the design, implementation, and usage of software systems, essential for understanding and maintaining them effectively.</p>

    <b>UNIT 4</b>
       <hr>
        <p>In computer science, several fundamental terms shape the understanding of programming concepts. An expression represents a combination of variables, values, and operators that yield a result. Variables store data that can change during program execution. Assignment operators, such as "=", assign values to variables. Functions, also known as procedures, encapsulate a set of instructions to perform a specific task. Conditional statements allow for decision-making within programs based on certain conditions. Logical operators, like "AND," "OR," and "NOT," manipulate boolean values to control program flow. Function calls invoke previously defined procedures to execute specific tasks. Strings represent sequences of characters within a program. Comparison operators, such as "==", "<", and ">", evaluate the relationship between two values. Boolean values, true or false, are essential for expressing logical conditions and making decisions in programming. Together, these terms form the foundational vocabulary of computer science and programming. </p>
