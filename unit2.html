       <div class="wave" id="L1">  <b>Lesson 1 C.F.U</b>
         <h1>How do you use the Internet?
<br>
         Think about your typical day. When are you using the Internet? For what purposes? What role does it have in your life?</h1>
       <p>I use internet when I am going to school to catch the bus, to complete school/homework, and to entertain myself when I have free time. It has a major roll in my life.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="wave" id="L2"> <b>Lesson 2 C.F.U</b>
        <h1> Describe two different paths that a message could take from Person A to Person D.</h1>
          <img src="https://images.code.org/2add28bbb25b056dda6f653744e48b3a-image-1566230419874.PNG" width="100" height="100" alt="q1">
          <p>Person A to Person D could follow one path by first reaching a local router, then passing through switches and routers in the local network, and finally traveling through the internet to reach Person D. Alternatively, the message could take a different path by utilizing a direct local connection between Person A and Person D if they are on the same local network, bypassing the broader internet infrastructure for a potentially faster and more direct communication route.</p>
            </div>
          <div class="wave" id="L3"><b>Lesson 3 C.F.U</b>
      <h1> 1. Pick the two statements that are true about the Internet Protocol (IP):</h1>
          <p>A.   Each device or computer on the Internet is assigned a unique IP address.<br>
          E.   IP is the shared way that all devices and computers label their messages with the sender and receiver's addresses.</p><hr>
            <h1>2. Describe how the Internet Protocol (IP) allows devices to easily connect and communicate on the Internet.</h1>
            <p>Internet Protocol allows devices to easily connect and communicate on the Internet by having a shared protocol through which data can be sent across the Internet through unique numbers, or IP addresses, to each connected device.</p>
           </div>
          <div class="wave" id="L4"><b>Lesson 4 C.F.U</b>
            <h1>1. Pick Two: If the post office delivered mail exactly like the routers deliver messages on the Internet, which of the following statements would be true?</h1>
              <p>B.   The mailman would sometimes take a different path to deliver each letter to your home<br> C.   Letters would be written on the outside of the envelope for all to read instead of letters put inside envelopes</p>
             <hr>
             <h1>2. What are the benefits of building redundancy into a network? What are the potential issues with building redundancy?</h1>
             <p>More redundancy equals more reliability. It also helps with distributed site management. The idea is that if one device fails, another can automatically take over.</p>
            </div>
       <div class="wave" id="L5">  <b>Lesson 5 C.F.U</b>
         <h1>Which of the following is true regarding the way information is transmitted on the Internet?</h1>
          <p>D.   Information does not travel in one piece, but rather as a datastream of packets.</p>

            <div class="wave" id="L6"><b>Lesson 6 C.F.U</b>
         <h1>In your own words explain the following about the Domain Name System
<br>
           -What problem does the DNS solve?<br>
           -How does the DNS help the world wide web scale so that billions of users can access billions of web pages?.</h1>
          <p>The problem that DNS, or the domain name system, solves is that it is responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses. </p>
              <hr>
         <h1>2. Choose the two statements that best describe the relationship between HTTP and the World Wide Web</h1>
         <p>B.   The World Wide Web is a collection of pages and files that is shared between computers using
         <br>  D.   HTTP and the World Wide Web both rely on other layers of protocols for sending information on the Internet</p>
