       <div class="wave" id="L1">  <b>Lesson 1 C.F.U</b>
         <h1>What are your own strategies and insights about how to learn best? And, how are they similar or different to the ones that you just heard about from other students?</h1>
       <p>The best way to learn is to observe and take notes and observe the class. Also asking for help and paying attention. And asking questions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="wave" id="L2"> <b>Lesson 2 C.F.U</b>
        <h1> Recall when you built your information sending device. Why did we decide to send a message as a sequence of two options rather than modifying our devices to represent more options?
<br>
         For example:
<br>
         Modifications with two options
<br>
         bend straw forward once
         bend straw backwards once
         bend straw forwards twice
         bend straw backwards twice
         vs.
<br>
         Four options
<br>
         bend straw forward
         bend straw backwards
         bend straw to the left
         bend straw to the right</h1>
          <p>Because with two options it can turn into more.</p>
            </div>
          <div class="wave" id="L3"><b>Lesson 3 C.F.U</b>
      <h1> How would you explain a number system to someone who had never seen numbers before?</h1>
          <p>I would explain the number system by stating that it is a system that uses the numbers 0-9 as the first ten,10^0, and the tens are represented as 10^1.</p>
           </div>
          <div class="wave" id="L4"><b>Lesson 4 C.F.U</b>
         <h1>1. How many bits would be needed to count all of the students in class today?</h1>
          <p>You would need 5 bits.</p>
            <hr>
         <h1>2. What are the similarities and differences between the binary and decimal systems?</h1>
         <p> Binary differs from the decimal system that we use every day, which uses ten digits ( 0-9 ) to represent values </p>
            </div>
       <div class="wave" id="L5">  <b>Lesson 5 C.F.U</b>
         <h1>1. Modern car odometers can record up to a million miles driven. What happens to the odometer reading when a car drives beyond its maximum reading?</h1>
          <p>The car odometers reverts back to zero after it has reached its maximum.</p>
         <hr>
         <h1>2. When using bits to represent fractions of a number, can you create all possible fractions? Why or why not?</h1>
         <p>No because bits go by a certain number and cannot do a fractions or else it would overflow.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wave" id="L7"><b>Lesson 7 C.F.U</b>
         <h1>1. Assume your friend just sent you 32 bits of pixel data (just the 0s and 1s for black and white pixels) that were encoded after sampling an image. Choose the two statements that are true.</h1>
          <p> C.    The correct width and height must be input into the pixelation widget to produce the image.
         <br>D.   The fact that only 32 bits were used to represent the image indicates relatively large sample squares were used. The digital image may vary from the analog image significantly.</p>
         <h1>2. Your computer science teacher asks you to sample a black and white image that is 4" x 6". How would you sample the image to provide a good digital approximation using the pixelation widget? What sample size would you use? How would your decision affect the digital representation</h1>
         <p>The largest dimensions we can make of an image with the pixelation widget is 255*255. When an image is resized, the number of pixels in the image may be reduced or increased, which causes the image to be resampled. Resampling changes the file size.</p>
           </div>
         <div class="wave" id="L8"><b>Lesson 8 C.F.U</b>
           <h1>1. Which statement about analog and digital images is true?</h1>
          <p>Sampling an analog image more frequently produces a digital image with a better representation.</p>
           <hr>
           <h1>2. Describe how the process of sampling, RGB pixels, and binary sequences work together to display a digital color image.</h1>
           <p>The process of sampling RGB pixel, and binary sequences work together by creating a numerous amount of number patterns to create different colors and shades.</p>
            </div>
         <div class="wave"id="L9"><b>Lesson 9 C.F.U</b>
           <h1>1. What is the most important quality of lossless compression?</h1>
          <p>The data is transformed to usually make it smaller. It can always be re-constructed back to the original.</p>
           <hr>
           <h1>An author is preparing to send their book to a publisher as an email attachment. The file on their computer is 1000 bytes. When they attach the file to their email, it shows as 750 bytes. The author gets very upset because they are concerned that part of their book has been deleted by the email provider.
<br>
           If you could talk to this author, how would you explain what is happening to their book?</h1>
           <p>If I could explain to this author what is happening I would say that their book is being compressed down so it can fit into the computer with 1000 bytes but nothing is being lost, just shortened.</p>
           </div>
         <div class="wave"id="L10"><b>Lesson 10 C.F.U</b>
           <h1>You’ve been given a new cell phone with a 2 gigabyte data plan. You plan to use your phone for text messages, images, video, and music. Which of these categories are best compressed using lossless compression? Which of these categories are best compressed using lossy compression? Why?</h1>
          <p>Images and video are best compressed using lossy compression because the images and video's can be reduced by bytes. Music are best compressed using lossless compression because the lyrics can be abbreviated.</p>
            </div>
         <div class="wave" id="L11"><b>Lesson 11 C.F.U</b>
           <h1>1. How is a Creative Commons license different from a regular copyright?</h1>
          <p> It allows your work to be shared, reused, and remixed to help spark more creativity.</p>
           <hr>
           <h1>2. Imagine you were using some of our pixelation tools to create an image and you posted it online for your friends to see - but, a week later you find out someone took that image and put it on a T-shirt that they’re selling for $10 each.
<br>
           Now that we understand Copyright, what would need to change in order for the scenario from the warm-up to be okay?</h1>
           <p>If the friend gave me a piece of that profit they made from selling the T-shirts then it would be ok. </p>
            </div>
         <div class="wave" id="L12"><b>Lesson 12 C.F.U</b>
           <h1>1. Many museums have digital catalogs of their collections. What are the potential benefits and harms of creating these digital catalogs?</h1>
          <p>Some potential benefits of digital catalogs are that they are easily accessible, can be viewed from virtually anywhere, and can be updated frequently</p>
           <hr>
           <h1>2. Why should we care about information being represented digitally? How does this impact you personally?</h1>
           <p>We should care about information being represented digitally because it can expand peoples knowlege about certain topics. This impacts me personally by having whatever I need online.</a></p>
